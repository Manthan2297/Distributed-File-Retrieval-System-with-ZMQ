# ðŸ“‚ Distributed File Retrieval System with ZMQ

This project is a distributed file indexing and search engine implemented in Java using **ZeroMQ** (JeroMQ) for networked communication. It enables multiple clients to connect to a central server, index files recursively from local directories, and perform keyword-based searches across documents uploaded by any connected client.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

With large-scale systems and growing data, it becomes crucial to design a scalable and concurrent system for searching documents. This system demonstrates:
- Client-side recursive file indexing.
- Server-side centralized storage and search handling.
- ZeroMQ-based messaging for decoupled architecture.
- Benchmarking across multiple clients and datasets.
